            Learning HTML and CSS is interesting because it allows us to create and design web pages visually, turning ideas into real websites. HTML helps in structuring the content, while CSS makes the pages attractive by adding colors, layouts, and styles. As beginners, seeing instant results in the browser makes learning enjoyable and motivating. Git can be a bit confusing at first, especially when working with repositories, branches, and push errors, but it is a powerful tool for managing code and tracking changes. With regular practice, Git becomes easier to understand and helps developers work more confidently and professionally.
